SpleetWaise builds on [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/), **a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still offering the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Designed to streamline expense tracking for students, SpleetWaise makes it easy to record and monitor both personal and shared expenses with contacts saved in the address book. With features to keep track of balances with friends, it eliminates the confusion often associated with managing shared costs, providing a clear, organised view of who has owes what. If you can type fast, SpleetWaise lets you handle your contact and expense management tasks more efficiently than traditional GUI apps, offering students a stress-free way to manage their expenses and shared balances with contacts.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for SpleetWaise.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar spleetwaise-[version].jar`
   command to run the application (*replace `[version]` with the release version you chose, for example, 1.5).<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe`
      to the Address Book.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

AddressBook and Transaction data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to

### Editing the data file

- AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`
- TransactionBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/transactionbook.json` 
- Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, SpleetWaise will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Transactions with invalid person IDs will not be loaded into the TransactionBook.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook or TransactionBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and before launching the app, copy the `data` folder over to its home folder from your previous SpleetWaise home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut
   `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to
   manually restore the minimized Help Window.
