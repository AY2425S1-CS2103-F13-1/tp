* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
    * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything
      from scratch)
    * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (
  called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written
      ** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write
      in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially
  created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`,
  `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the *
  *[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)
  **.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would
  like to contribute code to this project,
